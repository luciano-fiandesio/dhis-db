# DHIS2 database scripts

Bash scripts to setup and restore DHIS2 databases from https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-demo-db/tree/master/sierra-leone

These scritps are intended for **development purposes** only and only work on a local database.

When running the scripts in Linux, elevate to postgres user first (`sudo -i -u postgres`)
